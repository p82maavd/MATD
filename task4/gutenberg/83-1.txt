question which have been propos these—
“1 possibl transmit projectil up moon
“2 what exact distanc which separ earth 
satellit
“3 what period transit projectil when endow
suffici initi veloc consequ what moment
ought discharg order mai touch moon 
particular point
“4 what precis moment moon present herself most
favor posit reach projectil
“5 what point heaven ought cannon aim which 
end discharg projectil
“6 what place moon occupi heaven moment 
projectile’s departure
regard first question “i possibl transmit 
projectil up moon
swer—ye provid possess initi veloc 1200 yard
per second calcul prove suffici proport 
we reced earth action gravit diminish 
ers ratio squar distanc sai three
time given distanc action nine time less consequ
weight shot decreas becom reduc zero
instant attract moon exactli counterpois
earth sai 4752 passag 
tant projectil have no weight whatev if pass
point fall into moon sole effect lunar
traction theoret possibl experi 
efor absolut demonstr success must depend upon 
power engin emploi
second question “what exact distanc which
separ earth satellite
swer—the moon doe not describ circl round earth but
rather ellips which our earth occupi on foci 
consequ therefor certain time approach nearer
other reced farther earth astronom
languag on time apoge anoth perige now
differ between greatest least distanc too
consider left out consider point fact 
oge moon 247552 mile perige 218657 mile
y distant fact which make differ 28895 mile or more
than oneninth entir distanc perige distanc therefor
which ought serv basi all calcul
third question—
swer—if shot should preserv continu initi veloc
12000 yard per second would requir littl more than nine
hour reach destin but inasmuch initi veloc
continu decreas occupi 300000 second 
83hr 20m reach point where attract earth 
moon equilibrio thi point fall into 
moon 50000 second or 13hr 53m 20sec desir
efor discharg 97hr 13m 20sec befor arriv 
moon point aim 
regard question four “at what precis moment moon
present herself most favor posit etc
swer—after what been said abov necessari first
all choos period when moon perige 
so moment when she cross zenith which latter
event further diminish entir distanc length equal 
radiu earth i e 3919 mile result which 
final passag remain accomplish 214976
mile but although moon pass her perige everi month she doe
not reach zenith alwai exactli same moment she doe not
pear under these two condit simultan except long
erval time necessari therefor wait 
moment when her passag perige shall coincid 
zenith now fortun circumst 4th decemb 
ensu year moon present these two condit midnight
she perige her shortest distanc 
earth same moment she cross zenith
fifth question “at what point heaven ought cannon
aimed
swer—the preced remark be admit cannon ought 
point zenith place fire therefor 
perpendicular plane horizon projectil 
soonest pass beyond rang terrestri attract but 
order moon should reach zenith given place 
necessari place should not exce latitud declin
luminari other word must compris within 
degre 0 28 lat n or s everi other spot fire must
necessarili obliqu which would serious milit against 
success experi
sixth question “what place moon occupi 
ven moment projectile’s departure
swer—at moment when projectil shall discharg into
space moon which travel daili forward 13 10′ 35″ 
distant zenith point four time quantiti i e 
52 41′ 20″ space which correspond path which she 
describ dure entir journei projectil but inasmuch 
equal necessari take into account deviat which 
rotari motion earth impart shot shot
cannot reach moon until after deviat equal 16 radii 
earth which calcul upon moon’s orbit equal about
eleven degre becom necessari add these eleven degre 
those which express retard moon just mention 
sai round number about sixtyfour degre consequ 
moment fire visual radiu appli moon 
describ vertic line place angl sixtyfour
degre
e our answer question propos observatori 
cambridg member gun club—
sum up—
1st cannon ought plant countri situat between 0
d 28 n or s lat
2nd ought point directli toward zenith place
3rd projectil ought propel initi veloc 
12000 yard per second
4th ought discharg 10hr 46m 40sec 1st 
decemb ensu year
5th meet moon four dai after discharg precis 
midnight 4th decemb moment transit across
zenith
member gun club ought therefor without delai

“that evident repli nichol “and we must conclud our
tial speed under power 400000 pound guncotton
must have exceed requir 12000 yard now i can understand how
ter thirteen minut onli we met second satellit which
gravit round earth more than 2000 leagues’ distance
“and thi explan more probable ad barbican “becaus
throw off water enclos between partitionbreak 
projectil found itself lighten consider weight
“just so said nichol
“ah my brave nichol we saved

have breakfast
nichol not mistaken initi speed had been veri fortun
much abov estim cambridg observatori but 
cambridg observatori had nevertheless made mistak
travel recov thi fals alarm breakfast merrili if
at good deal thei talk more their confid greater

“why should we not succeed said michel ardan “why should we not
rive safe we launch we have no obstacl befor us no
stone wai road open more so than ship
battl sea more open than balloon battl 
wind if ship can reach destin balloon go where
pleas why cannot our projectil attain end aim
“it attain it said barbican
“if onli do honor americans ad michel ardan “the onli
peopl who could bring such enterpris happi termin 
onli on which could produc presid barbican ah now we 
no longer uneasi i begin think what becom us we shall
get right royal weary
barbican nichol made gestur denial
“but i have provid conting my friends repli michel
“you have onli speak i have chess draught card 
domino your dispos noth want but billiardtable
“what exclaim barbican “you brought awai such trifles
“certainly repli michel “and not onli distract ourselv but
so laudabl intent endow selenit smoke
divan them
“my friend said barbican “if moon inhabit inhabit
must have appear some thousand year befor those earth
we cannot doubt their star much older than our if then
e selenit have exist their hundr thousand year 
if their brain same organ human brain thei
have alreadi invent all we have invent even what we mai
ent futur ag thei have noth learn us we
have everyth learn them
“what said michel “you believ thei have artist like phidia
michael angelo or raphael
“yes
“poet like homer virgil milton lamartin hugo
“i am sure it
“philosoph like plato aristotl descart kant
“i have no doubt it
“scientif men like archimed euclid pascal newton
“i could swear it
“comic writer like arnal photograph like—like nadar
“certain
“then friend barbican if thei strong we even
stronger—these selenites—why have thei not tri commun 
earth why have thei not launch lunar projectil our
terrestri regions
“who told you thei have never done so said barbican serious
“indeed ad nichol “it would easier them than us 
two reason first becaus attract moon’s surfac six
time less than earth which would allow projectil 
rise more easili secondli becaus would enough send such 
projectil onli 8000 leagu instead 80000 which would requir
forc project ten time less strong
“then continu michel “i repeat why have thei not done it
“and i repeat said barbican “who told you thei have not done

“when
“thousand year befor man appear earth
“and projectile—where projectil i demand see 
projectile
“my friend repli barbican “the sea cover fivesixth our
globe we mai draw five good reason suppos 
lunar projectil if ever launch now bottom 
lantic or pacif unless sped into some crevass 
period when crust earth not yet hardened
“old barbicane said michel “you have answer everyth i
bow befor your wisdom but there on hypothesi would suit me
ter than all other which selenit be older than
we wiser have not invent gunpowder
thi moment diana join convers sonor bark
she ask her breakfast
“ah said michel ardan “in our discuss we have forgotten diana 
satellite
immedi goodsiz pie given dog which devour 
hungrili
“do you see barbicane said michel “we should have made second
noah’s ark thi projectil born us moon coupl
everi kind domest animal
“i dare sai but room would have fail us
“oh said michel “we might have squeez little
“the fact is repli nichol “that cow bull hors all

unfortun car could neither have been made stabl nor

“well we might have least brought donkei onli littl donkei
courag beast which old silenu love mount i love those
old donkei thei least favor anim creation thei 
not onli beaten while aliv but even after thei dead
“how do you make out ask barbican “why said michel “thei
make their skin into drums
barbican nichol could not help laugh thi ridicul
remark but cry their merri companion stop them latter
lean over spot where satellit lai rose sai
“my good satellit no longer ill
“ah said nichol
“no answer michel “he dead there ad piteou
e “that embarrass i much fear my poor diana you 
leav no progeni lunar regions
eed unfortun satellit had not surviv wound 
quit dead michel ardan look hi friend rueful
counten
“one question present itself said barbican “we cannot keep 
dead bodi thi dog us next fortyeight hours
“no certainli not repli nichol “but our scuttl fix 
hing thei can let down we open on throw bodi out
o space
presid thought some moment then said
“ye we must do so but same time take veri great
precautions
“why ask michel
“for two reason which you understand answer barbican “the
first relat air shut up projectil which we
must lose littl possible
“but we manufactur air
“onli part we make onli oxygen my worthi michel 
regard we must watch apparatu doe not furnish 
oxygen too great quantiti excess would bring us veri
seriou physiolog troubl but if we make oxygen we do not
make azot medium which lung do not absorb which
ought remain intact azot escap rapidli through 
open scuttles
“oh time throw out poor satellite said michel
“agre but we must act quickly
“and second reason ask michel
“the second reason we must not let outer cold which 
excess penetr projectil or we shall frozen death
“but sun
“the sun warm our projectil which absorb rai but doe not
warm vacuum which we float thi moment where there 
no air there no more heat than diffus light same 
dark cold where sun’s rai do not strike direct thi
temperatur onli temperatur produc radiat 
star sai what terrestri globe would undergo if 
sun disappear on day
“which not feared repli nichol
“who knows said michel ardan “but admit sun doe
not go out might not happen earth might move awai 

“there said barbican “there michel hi ideas
“and continu michel “do we not know 1861 earth pass
through tail comet or let us suppos comet whose power 
traction greater than sun terrestri orbit 
d toward wander star earth becom satellit
drawn such distanc rai sun have no
tion surface
“that might happen indeed repli barbican “but consequ
such displac need not so formid you suppose
“and why not
“becaus heat cold would equal our globe been
calcul had our earth been carri along cours 
comet 1861 perihelion nearest approach 
sun would have undergon heat 28000 time greater than 
summer but thi heat which suffici evapor water
would have form thick ring cloud which would have modifi 
excess temperatur henc compens between cold 
ion heat perihelion
“at how mani degrees ask nichol “i temperatur 
planetari space estimated
“formerly repli barbican “it greatli exager but now
ter calcul fourier french academi scienc 
not suppos exce 60 centigrad below zero
“pooh said michel “that’s nothing
“it veri much repli barbican “the temperatur which 
observ polar region melvil island fort relianc
76 fahrenheit below zero
“if i mistak not said nichol “m pouillet anoth savant
estim temperatur space 250 fahrenheit below zero we
shall howev abl verifi these calcul ourselves
“not present becaus solar rai beat directli upon our
momet would give contrari veri high temperatur but
when we arriv moon dure fifteen dai night either
face we shall have leisur make experi our satellit
li vacuum
“what do you mean vacuum ask michel “i perfectli such
“it absolut void air
“and air replac noth whatever
“by ether only repli barbican
“and prai what ether
“the ether my friend agglomer imponder atom
which rel their dimens far remov each
other celesti bodi space these atom which 
r vibratori motion produc both light heat universe
now proceed burial satellit thei had mere drop

thei breakfast question michel’s relat

“but said barbican “i do not see how could have been stopped
“but let us suppos so said michel
“it imposs supposition said practic barbican
“unless impuls forc had fail but even then speed would
diminish degre would not have stop suddenly
“admit had struck bodi space
“what body
“why enorm meteor which we met
“then said nichol “the projectil would have been broken into 
thousand piec we it
“more than that repli barbican “we should have been burn 
death
“burned exclaim michel “by jove i am sorri did not happen
‘just see’
“and you would have seen repli barbican “it known now 
t onli modif motion when water warmed—that

barbican could not help smile michel’s repli then return

ball which fall burn state after have struck

firm if our projectil had struck meteor speed thu
suddenli check would have rais heat great enough turn into

“then ask nichol “what would happen if earth’s motion

“her temperatur would rais such pitch said barbican
“that she would onc reduc vapor
“well said michel “that wai end earth which

“and if earth fell upon sun ask nichol

“oh dear murmur michel “the figur coming
“thei have even calculated continu imperturb barbican
“that shock each meteor sun ought produc heat equal
4000 mass coal equal bulk

“it equal produc combust stratum coal

“and heat—
“would abl boil two billion nine hundr million cubic

“i see all best said michel “and thi
mospher us invent not onli allow us breath

“ye if we do not take into consider refract produc

moon find itself beyond cone pure shadow sun
send her rai not onli edg but also center
“then said michel merri tone “why there eclips when
