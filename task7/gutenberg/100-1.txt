fairest creatur we desir increas
ebi beauty’s rose might never die
but riper should time deceas
hi tender heir might bear hi memori
but thou contract thine own bright ey
feed’st thy light’s flame selfsubstanti fuel
make famin where abund li
thy self thy foe thy sweet self too cruel
thou art now world’s fresh ornament
d onli herald gaudi spring
n thine own bud buriest thy content
d tender churl mak’st wast niggard
piti world or els thi glutton 
eat world’s due grave thee
2
when forti winter shall besieg thy brow
d dig deep trench thy beauty’s field
thy youth’s proud liveri so gaze now
tatter weed small worth held
be ask where all thy beauti li
where all treasur thy lusti dai
sai within thine own deep sunken ey
alleat shame thriftless prais
how much more prais deserv’d thy beauty’s us
if thou couldst answer ‘thi fair child mine
shall sum my count make my old excuse’
prove hi beauti success thine
thi new made when thou art old
see thy blood warm when thou feel’st cold
3
look thy glass tell face thou viewest
now time face should form anoth
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguil world unbless some mother
where she so fair whose unear womb
disdain tillag thy husbandri
or who so fond tomb
hi selflov stop poster
thou art thy mother’s glass she thee
call back love april her prime
so thou through window thine ag shalt see
despit wrinkl thi thy golden time
but if thou live rememb not 
die singl thine imag di thee
4
unthrifti loveli why dost thou spend
upon thy self thy beauty’s legaci
nature’s bequest give noth but doth lend
d be frank she lend those free
beauteou niggard why dost thou abus
bounteou largess given thee give
profitless usur why dost thou us
so great sum sum yet canst not live
have traffic thy self alon
thou thy self thy sweet self dost deceiv
how when natur call thee gone
what accept audit canst thou leav
thy unus beauti must tomb thee
which us live th’ executor 
5
those hour gentl work did frame
love gaze where everi ey doth dwell
plai tyrant veri same
d unfair which fairli doth excel
neverrest time lead summer 
hideou winter confound him there
sap check frost lusti leav quit gone
uti o’ersnow bare everi where
not summer’s distil left
liquid prison pent wall glass
uty’s effect beauti bereft
nor nor no remembr what 
but flower distil though thei winter meet
lees but their show their substanc still live sweet
6
let not winter’s rag hand defac
thy summer er thou distil
make sweet some vial treasur thou some place
beauty’s treasur er selfkil
us not forbidden usuri
which happi those pai will loan
s thy self breed anoth thee
or ten time happier ten on
ten time thy self happier than thou art
if ten thine ten time refigur thee
what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leav thee live poster
not selfwil thou art much too fair
death’s conquest make worm thine heir
7
lo orient when graciou light
lift up hi burn head each under ey
doth homag hi newappear sight

yet mortal look ador hi beauti still

but when highmost pitch weari car

hi low tract look anoth wai
so thou thy self outgo thy noon
unlook diest unless thou get son
8
music hear why hear’st thou music sadli
sweet sweet war not joi delight joi
why lov’st thou which thou receiv’st not gladli
or els receiv’st pleasur thine annoi
if true concord welltun sound
union marri do offend thine ear

mark how on string sweet husband anoth
strike each each mutual order
resembl sire child happi mother
who all on on pleas note do sing
whose speechless song be mani seem on
sing thi thee ‘thou singl wilt prove none’
9
fear wet widow’s ey
thou consum’st thy self singl life
if thou issueless shalt hap die
world wail thee like makeless wife
world thy widow still weep
thou no form thee hast left behind
when everi privat widow well mai keep
children’s ey her husband’s shape mind
look what unthrift world doth spend
shift but hi place still world enjoi 
but beauty’s wast hath world end
d kept unus user so destroi 
no love toward other bosom sit
himself such murd’rou shame commit
10
shame deni thou bear’st love ani
who thy self art so unprovid
grant if thou wilt thou art belov mani
but thou none lov’st most evid
thou art so possess murd’rou hate
’gainst thy self thou stick’st not conspir
seek beauteou roof ruinat
which repair should thy chief desir
o chang thy thought i mai chang my mind
shall hate fairer lodg than gentl love
thy presenc graciou kind
or thy self least kindheart prove
make thee anoth self love me
beauti still mai live thine or thee
11
fast thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st
thine which thou departest
d fresh blood which youngli thou bestow’st
thou mayst call thine when thou youth convertest
ein live wisdom beauti increas
ut thi folli ag cold decai
if all mind so time should ceas
d threescor year would make world awai
let those whom natur hath not made store
harsh featureless rude barrenli perish
look whom she best endow she gave thee more
which bounteou gift thou shouldst bounti cherish
she carv thee her seal meant therebi
thou shouldst print more not let copi die
12
when i do count clock tell time
d see brave dai sunk hideou night
when i behold violet past prime
d sabl curl all silver o’er white
when lofti tree i see barren leav
which erst heat did canopi herd
d summer’s green all gird up sheav
born bier white bristli beard
thy beauti do i question make
thou among wast time must go
sinc sweet beauti do themselv forsak
d die fast thei see other grow
noth ’gainst time’s scyth can make defenc
save breed brave him when take thee henc
13
o you your self but love you 
no longer your than you your self here live
ainst thi come end you should prepar
d your sweet semblanc some other give
so should beauti which you hold leas
find no determin then you 
your self again after your self’s deceas
when your sweet issu your sweet form should bear
who let so fair hous fall decai
which husbandri honour might uphold
ainst stormi gust winter’s dai
d barren rage death’s etern cold
o none but unthrift dear my love you know
you had father let your son sai so
14
not star do i my judgement pluck
d yet methink i have astronomi

nor can i fortun brief minut tell

but thine ey my knowledg i deriv
d constant star them i read such art

if thy self store thou wouldst convert
or els thee thi i prognost

15
when i consid everi thing grow
hold perfect but littl moment
thi huge stage presenteth nought but show
whereon star secret influenc comment
when i perceiv men plant increas

vaunt their youth sap height decreas
d wear their brave state out memori
conceit thi inconst stai
set you most rich youth befor my sight
where wast time debateth decai
chang your dai youth sulli night
all war time love you
take you i engraft you new
16
but wherefor do not you mightier wai
make war upon thi bloodi tyrant time
d fortifi your self your decai
mean more bless than my barren rhyme
now stand you top happi hour
d mani maiden garden yet unset
virtuou wish would bear you live flower
much liker than your paint counterfeit
so should line life life repair
which thi time’s pencil or my pupil pen
neither inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live your self ey men
give awai your self keep your self still
you must live drawn your own sweet skill
17
who believ my vers time come
if fill your most high desert
though yet heaven know but tomb
which hide your life show not half your part
if i could write beauti your ey
d fresh number number all your grace
ag come would sai thi poet li
such heavenli touch ne’er touch earthli face
so should my paper yellow their ag
scorn like old men less truth than tongu
d your true right term poet’s rage
d stretch metr antiqu song
but some child your aliv time
you should live twice my rhyme
18
shall i compar thee summer’s dai

rough wind do shake darl bud mai
d summer’s leas hath all too short date
sometim too hot ey heaven shine
d often hi gold complexion dim
d everi fair fair sometim declin

but thy etern summer shall not fade
nor lose possess fair thou ow’st
nor shall death brag thou wand’rest hi shade
when etern line time thou grow’st
so long men can breath or ey can see
so long live thi thi give life thee
19
devour time blunt thou lion’s paw
d make earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck keen teeth fierc tiger’s jaw
d burn longliv phoenix her blood
make glad sorri season thou fleet’st
d do whate’er thou wilt swiftfoot time

but i forbid thee on most heinou crime
o carv not thy hour my love’s fair brow
nor draw no line there thine antiqu pen

beauty’s pattern succeed men
yet do thy worst old time despit thy wrong
my love shall my vers ever live young
20

so long youth thou on date
but when thee time’s furrow i behold

o therefor love thyself so wari

33
full mani gloriou morn have i seen

permit basest cloud ride
ugli rack hi celesti face
d forlorn world hi visag hide
steal unseen west thi disgrac
even so my sun on earli morn did shine
all triumphant splendour my brow
but out alack but on hour mine
region cloud hath mask him me now
yet him thi my love no whit disdaineth
sun world mai stain when heaven’s sun staineth
34
why didst thou promis such beauteou dai
d make me travel forth without my cloak
let base cloud o’ertak me my wai
hide thy brav’ry their rotten smoke
’ti not enough through cloud thou break
dry rain my stormbeaten face
no man well such salv can speak
heal wound cure not disgrac
nor can thy shame give physic my grief
though thou repent yet i have still loss
th’ offender’s sorrow lend but weak relief
him bear strong offence’s cross
ah but those tear pearl which thy love shed
thei rich ransom all ill deed
35
no more griev which thou hast done
rose have thorn silver fountain mud
cloud eclips stain both moon sun
d loathsom canker live sweetest bud
l men make fault even i thi
thoriz thy trespass compar
my self corrupt salv thy amiss
excus thy sin more than thy sin 
thy sensual fault i bring sens

d ’gainst my self law plea commenc
such civil war my love hate

sweet thief which sourli rob me
36
let me confess we two must twain
though our undivid love on
so shall those blot do me remain
ut thy help me born alon
our two love there but on respect
though our live separ spite
which though alter not love’s sole effect
yet doth steal sweet hour love’s delight
i mai not evermor acknowledg thee
lest my bewail guilt should do thee shame
nor thou public kind honour me
unless thou take honour thy name
but do not so i love thee such sort
thou be mine mine thy good report
37
decrepit father take delight
see hi activ child do deed youth
so i made lame fortune’s dearest spite
take all my comfort thy worth truth
whether beauti birth or wealth or wit
or ani these all or all or more
entitl thy part do crown sit
i make my love engraft thi store
so then i am not lame poor nor despis
whilst thi shadow doth such substanc give
i thy abund am suffic
d part all thy glori live
look what best best i wish thee
thi wish i have then ten time happi me
38
how can my muse want subject invent
while thou dost breath pour’st into my vers
thine own sweet argument too excel
everi vulgar paper rehears
o give thy self thank if aught me
worthi perus stand against thy sight
who’s so dumb cannot write thee
when thou thy self dost give invent light
thou tenth muse ten time more worth
than those old nine which rhymer invoc
d call thee let him bring forth
etern number outliv long date
if my slight muse do pleas these curiou dai
pain mine but thine shall prais
39
o how thy worth manner mai i sing
when thou art all better part me
what can mine own prais mine own self bring
d what is’t but mine own when i prais thee
even thi let us divid live
d our dear love lose name singl on
thi separ i mai give

o absenc what torment wouldst thou prove
not thy sour leisur gave sweet leav
entertain time thought love
which time thought so sweetli doth deceiv
thou teachest how make on twain
prais him here who doth henc remain
40
take all my love my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst befor
no love my love thou mayst true love call
l mine thine befor thou hadst thi more
if my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee my love thou usest
but yet blame if thou thy self deceivest
wil tast what thy self refusest
i do forgiv thy robberi gentl thief
though thou steal thee all my poverti
d yet love know greater grief
bear greater wrong than hate’s known injuri
lascivi grace whom all ill well show
kill me spite yet we must not foe
41
those pretti wrong liberti commit
when i am sometim absent thy heart
thy beauti thy year full well befit
still temptat follow where thou art
gentl thou art therefor won
uteou thou art therefor assail
d when woman woo what woman’s son
sourli leav her till have prevail

d chide thy beauti thy strai youth
who lead thee their riot even there
where thou art forc break twofold truth

43
when most i wink then do mine ey best see

how would thy shadow’s form form happi show

when dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavi sleep sightless ey doth stai

44
if dull substanc my flesh thought

sweet odour which doth live
canker bloom have full deep dye
